    for classification
- Question1.ipynb - Codebook for Question 1
- Question2.ipynb - Codebook for Question 2
- Question3.ipynb - Codebook for Question 3

How to run
1. Setup
    a. Load the files into your environment of choice. Make sure that all python
        scripts and notebooks are together in the same folder!!!! That way the
        dependent scripts and notebookscan import and run functions from other
        scripts.
    b. Ensure that you have all the necessary packages.
2. How to run Jupyter notebooks (Question1.ipynb, Question2.ipynb,
    Question3.ipynb)
    a. Open the Jupyter notebook into your IDE of choice. You may run the
        notebooks in any order you wish.
    b. Press "Run All" or any equivalent to run all code chunks.
    c. WARNING: Code will take a long time to run.

- Please be patient when running the scripts. They may be run in any order,
    but the code chunks within the notebooks must be run in order.
